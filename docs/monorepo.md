description: Adopt the standard on a monorepo — one workflow call per package, scoped by `source`.

# Adopt on a Monorepo

A monorepo adopts the standard **one workflow call per package**: each `uses:` job names its
package's real source directory, and the workflow derives everything else from the package
itself. All seven gates run per call. This repository consumes itself the same way — its
dogfood workflow is exactly this file with our package paths.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/conventions.yml
name: Conventions
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  python:
    uses: thekevinscott/testing-conventions/.github/workflows/testing-conventions.yml@v0
    with:
      source: packages/python/yourpkg

  typescript:
    uses: thekevinscott/testing-conventions/.github/workflows/testing-conventions.yml@v0
    with:
      source: packages/ts/src

  rust:
    uses: thekevinscott/testing-conventions/.github/workflows/testing-conventions.yml@v0
    with:
      source: packages/rust
```

Each `source` names a **source directory**, and the whole package still runs: the unit-tier
checks and language detection scan `source`, while the install, the build, the packaging check,
and the `tests/integration/` and `tests/e2e/` suites run at the **package root** — the nearest
directory at or above `source` holding a manifest. The `typescript` call above scans
`packages/ts/src` and runs its suites and build at `packages/ts`. On a single-package
repository the drop-in carries no inputs — `source` defaults to `src`
([Getting Started](./getting-started)); on a monorepo each call names its package's source
directory, because `source` is the only scoping mechanism
([workflow reference](./reference/workflow)).

## Everything derives from the package

`source` is the scan root and the only scoping mechanism. From it, each call derives:

- **The package root** — the nearest directory at or above `source` holding a `package.json`,
  `pyproject.toml`, or `Cargo.toml`. Dependency installs, builds, `dist/` discovery, and
  `e2e-attestations/` receipt discovery all happen there.
- **The languages** — every supported language with sources under `source` runs its gates.
- **The package manager** — the manifest's `packageManager` field, else the package's lockfile
  (npm and pnpm).
- **The Python environment** — a `pyproject.toml` with a `[project]` table is provisioned with
  uv, and the suite runs inside that environment.
- **The native toolchain** — a manifest that declares a Rust-compiling build (a maturin
  backend, a napi config, a `Cargo.toml` at the package root) provisions cargo, and the build
  runs through the manifest's own hooks: `uv sync` compiles a maturin module; the install runs
  an npm package's `prepare` script.
- **The config** — a `testing-conventions.toml` at the package root governs that package: its
  floors, and `exempt` entries whose `path` resolves relative to the call's scan root
  (`integration lint`'s suite subjects: relative to the package root the tiers derive from).
- **The test tiers** — the standard's suite layout, derived from the package root: colocated
  unit tests sit beside the sources under `source`, the integration suite lives in
  `<package root>/tests/integration/`, and the e2e suite in `<package root>/tests/e2e/` (Rust
  keeps both out-of-crate suites in the crate root's `tests/`, cargo's own layout).
  `integration lint` takes its subjects from the derived suite directories, and the unit-tier
  scans cover `source` and leave `<package root>/tests/` to the suites — one call runs every tier
  of the package.

Two optional inputs refine a call: `languages` restricts the detected set explicitly, and
`config` names a config file somewhere other than the package root.

## Escape hatches

Two inputs and one config key cover what a manifest cannot express. They carry the same bar as
[exemptions](./guide/configure#exempt-a-file) — a reasoned last resort, with the manifest-level
fix preferred:

- **`build_command`** — a build step beyond the manifest's own hooks, declared per language in the
  package's own `testing-conventions.toml` and run at the package root. Each language's standard
  build is derived (a maturin/PEP 517 backend, Cargo's `build.rs` and `cargo package`, npm's
  `prepare` / `prepack`); `build_command` names only what an ecosystem structurally can't
  standardize — a PEP 517 backend's absent pre-build shell step, or a TypeScript compile in a
  `build` script npm doesn't run on `pack`. It supplies a necessary fact rather than waiving a
  check, so unlike the other escape hatches it needs no `reason`.
- **`rust_toolchain`** — forces cargo provisioning when no manifest declares the need.
- **`gates`** — restricts a call to named gates, for the rare package where one genuinely
  cannot run.
