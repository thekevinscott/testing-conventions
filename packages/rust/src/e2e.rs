//! `e2e attest` / `e2e verify` (#17) — the e2e attestation nudge.
//!
//! `attest` runs the e2e suite locally and records that it ran against the
//! current commit; `verify` (a later slice, #68) confirms in CI that the latest
//! code commit is attested. The point is to *nudge* agents to run e2e locally —
//! CI never runs e2e, it only checks the committed attestation.
//!
//! This module implements both `attest` (#67) and `verify` (#68).
