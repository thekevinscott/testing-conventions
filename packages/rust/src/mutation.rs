//! Mutation testing for Rust (`unit mutation --language rust`, #201) — the rung
//! above coverage. A test that *runs* a line still passes if you delete its
//! assertions; a surviving mutant proves it. This module wraps
//! [cargo-mutants](https://github.com/sourcefrog/cargo-mutants): it runs the engine,
//! reads its `outcomes.json`, and reports the **surviving** mutants the suite failed
//! to catch.
//!
//! The gate is **binary, not a percentage** (equivalent mutants make a fixed score
//! unreachable, and a score isn't comparable across engines) and on by default: any
//! *un-exempted* surviving mutant is a finding. This module stays a pure measurement —
//! [`measure_rust`] returns the survivors and [`unexplained_survivors`] is the pure
//! core over a parsed report; the CLI layer turns a non-empty result into the failure.
//!
//! Diff-scoping (`--base`) is delegated to cargo-mutants' own `--in-diff`: the
//! `<base>...HEAD` diff is written out and passed through, so only mutants on changed
//! lines are tested ("no unexplained surviving mutant on the lines you touched").
